# Phylogenetic Tree Service

## Overview

The bacterial Phylogenetic Tree Service enables construction of custom phylogenetic trees built from user-selected genomes. The **Codon Tree** method selects single-copy BV-BRC PGFams and analyzes aligned proteins and coding DNA from single-copy genes using the program RAxML. The service returns a Scaled Vector Graphics (SVG) image of the final tree, as well as a Newick file which can be rendered in the interactive Phylogenetic Tree Viewer in BV-BRC or downloaded and viewed in FigTree or other software.



## About this module

This module is a component of the BV-BRC build system. It is designed to fit into the
`dev_container` infrastructure which manages development and production deployment of
the components of the BV-BRC. More documentation is available [here](https://github.com/BV-BRC/dev_container/tree/master/README.md).

This module provides the following application specfication(s):
* [CodonTree](app_specs/CodonTree.md)
